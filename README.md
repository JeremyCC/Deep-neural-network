# Deep-neural-network
DL2017 - HW2, iteratively  create a NN and train it

This is a tensorflow work with version 1.0

The "Train_DNN.py" file can specify a classical neural network
You can decide the number of layers and neurons each layer by simply specify it in parameter section

The "Train_CNN.py" file can specify a classical convolution neural network
You can decide the convolution and FCN layer the specify the detail in paramter section

For DNN
All the result will be saved to a specified folder
including trained parameters, tensorboard event, learning curve and weight distribution drawn by matplotlib

For CNN
there won't be result drawn by matplotlib, all result please refer to Tensorboard

the default dataset for DNN is mnist
and for CNN is cifar10 while you need to put the data inside the "cifar10" folder yourself
you can change it yourslef
